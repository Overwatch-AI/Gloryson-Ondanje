    "contextualized_text": "This document excerpt is from the Performance Dispatch Takeoff section, providing correction tables for calculating the required Takeoff Field Length for a Boeing 737-600 on a wet runway. The process involves a two-step adjustment where the base field length is first modified for the runway's slope (gradient), and this \"Slope Corrected Field Length\" is then further adjusted for the wind component (headwind or tailwind). The final value ensures the calculated takeoff distance accounts for these non-standard runway and weather conditions.\n\nPerformance Dispatch Takeoff 737-600/CFM56-7B22 FAA/JAROPS Category D Brakes Takeoff Field Corrections - Wet Runway Slope Corrections FIELD LENGTH SLOPE CORRECTED FIELD LENGTH (M) AVAILABLE RUNWAY SLOPE (%) (M) -2.0 -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 1200 1240 1230 1220 1210 1200 1180 1170 1150 1130 1400 1470 1450 1430 1420 1400 1370 1340 1310 1290 1600 1700 1670 1650 1620 1600 1560 1520 1480 1440 1800 1930 1900 1860 1830 1800 1750 1700 1650 1600 2000 2160 2120 2080 2040 2000 1940 1880 1810 1750 2200 2390 2340 2290 2250 2200 2130 2050 1980 1900 2400 2620 2560 2510 2450 2400 2310 2230 2140 2060 2600 2850 2790 2720 2660 2600 2500 2410 2310 2210 2800 3080 3010 2940 2870 2800 2690 2580 2480 2370 3000 3310 3230 3160 3080 3000 2880 2760 2640 2520 3200 3540 3460 3370 3290 3200 3070 2940 2810 2680 3400 3770 3680 3590 3490 3400 3260 3120 2970 2830 3600 4000 3900 3800 3700 3600 3450 3290 3140 2990 3800 4230 4120 4020 3910 3800 3640 3470 3310 3140 4000 4460 4350 4230 4120 4000 3820 3650 3470 3300 4200 4690 4570 4450 4320 4200 4010 3830 3640 3450 4400 4920 4790 4660 4530 4400 4200 4000 3800 3600 4600 5150 5020 4880 4740 4600 4390 4180 3970 3760 4800 5380 5240 5090 4950 4800 4580 4360 4140 3910 Wind Corrections SLOPE CORR'D SLOPE & WIND CORRECTED FIELD LENGTH (M) FIELD LENGTH WIND COMPONENT (KTS) (M) -15 -10 -5 0 10 20 30 40 1200 830 960 1080 1200 1280 1370 1450 1550 1400 1000 1130 1270 1400 1490 1580 1680 1770 1600 1170 1310 1460 1600 1690 1790 1900 2000 1800 1340 1490 1650 1800 1900 2010 2120 2230 2000 1510 1670 1840 2000 2110 2220 2340 2460 2200 1680 1850 2030 2200 2310 2430 2560 2690 2400 1850 2030 2220 2400 2520 2640 2780 2920 2600 2020 2210 2410 2600 2720 2860 3000 3140 2800 2190 2390 2600 2800 2930 3070 3220 3370 3000 2360 2570 2790 3000 3140 3280 3440 3600 3200 2520 2750 2970 3200 3340 3490 3660 3830 3400 2690 2930 3160 3400 3550 3710 3880 4060 3600 2860 3110 3350 3600 3750 3920 4100 4290 3800 3030 3290 3540 3800 3960 4130 4320 4520 4000 3200 3470 3730 4000 4170 4350 4540 4740 4200 3370 3650 3920 4200 4370 4560 4760 4970 4400 3540 3830 4110",

The table provides \"Slope Corrected Field Length\" values, which are adjustments to the basic required runway distance based on the \"Available Runway Slope\". A positive (uphill) slope increases the required field length, while a negative (downhill) slope decreases it, ensuring regulatory performance requirements are met.\n\n3830 3400 2690 2930 3160 3400 3550 3710 3880 4060 3600 2860 3110 3350 3600 3750 3920 4100 4290 3800 3030 3290 3540 3800 3960 4130 4320 4520 4000 3200 3470 3730 4000 4170 4350 4540 4740 4200 3370 3650 3920 4200 4370 4560 4760 4970 4400 3540 3830 4110 4400 4580 4770 4980 5200 4600 3710 4010 4300 4600 4780 4980 5200 5430 4800 3880 4190 4490 4800 4990 5200 5420 5660 5000 4050 4360 4680 5000 5200 5410 5640 5890",

    "contextualized_text": "This performance dispatch table is used to determine the enroute maximum operating altitude for a 737-600 operating at maximum cruise thrust. The data correlates aircraft weight and International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) temperature deviation with the highest altitude that maintains a specified \"Margin to Initial Buffet,\" a G-load buffer from aerodynamic stall also expressed as a bank angle. Altitudes marked with an asterisk are limited by available engine thrust (thrust-limited) rather than buffet margin, while still providing a 100 fpm residual climb rate.\n\n737-600/CFM56-7B22 FAA/JAROPS Category D Brakes\n\nPerformance Dispatch\n\nChapter PD\n\nSection 11\n\nLong Range Cruise Maximum Operating Altitude PD.11 Performance Dispatch-Enroute Max Cruise Thrust\n\nISA + 10\u00b0C and Below\n\nWEIGHT OPTIMUM TAT MARGIN TO INITIAL BUFFET 'G' (BANK ANGLE) (1000 KG) ALT (FT) (\u00b0C) 1.20 (33\u00b0) 1.25 (36\u00b0) 1.30 (39\u00b0) 1.40 (44\u00b0) 1.50 (48\u00b0) 70 34500 -15 37700* 37700* 37700* 36400 35100 65 36000 -18 39200* 39200* 39200* 38000 36600 60 37700 -18 40700* 40700* 40700* 39700 38300 55 39500 -18 41000 41000 41000 41000 40100 50 41000 -18 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000 45 41000 -18 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000 40 41000 -18 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000 35 41000 -18 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000\n\nISA + 15\u00b0C\n\nWEIGHT OPTIMUM TAT MARGIN TO INITIAL BUFFET 'G' (BANK ANGLE) (1000 KG) ALT (FT) (\u00b0C) 1.20 (33\u00b0) 1.25 (36\u00b0) 1.30 (39\u00b0) 1.40 (44\u00b0) 1.50 (48\u00b0) 70 34500 -9 37000* 37000* 37000* 36400 35100 65 36000 -13 38300* 38300* 38300* 38000 36600 60 37700 -13 39800* 39800* 39800* 39700 38300 55 39500 -13 41000 41000 41000 41000 40100 50 41000 -13 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000 45 41000 -13 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000 40 41000 -13 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000 35 41000 -13 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000\n\nISA + 20\u00b0C\n\nWEIGHT OPTIMUM TAT MARGIN TO INITIAL BUFFET 'G' (BANK ANGLE) (1000 KG) ALT (FT) (\u00b0C) 1.20 (33\u00b0) 1.25 (36\u00b0) 1.30 (39\u00b0) 1.40 (44\u00b0) 1.50 (48\u00b0) 70 34500 -4 35700* 35700* 35700* 35700* 35100 65 36000 -7 37200* 37200* 37200* 37200* 36600 60 37700 -7 38700* 38700* 38700* 38700* 38300 55 39500 -7 40200* 40200* 40200* 40200* 40100 50 41000 -7 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000 45 41000 -7 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000 40 41000 -7 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000 35 41000 -7 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000\n\n*Denotes altitude thrust limited in level flight, 100 fpm residual rate of climb.",

    "contextualized_text": "This section is for enroute performance dispatch planning, providing data to calculate the critical fuel reserves required for a diversion from the most critical point on a route following a failure such as depressurization. The tables allow conversion of ground distance to air distance by accounting for headwind/tailwind components and then determine the required fuel based on the aircraft's weight at the critical point. The fuel calculation is based on a specific flight profile including an emergency descent to 10,000 ft, cruise, and hold, with adjustments for non-standard atmospheric conditions.\n\nPerformance Dispatch Enroute 737-600/CFM56-7B22 FAA/JAROPS Category D Brakes ALL ENGINES Long Range Cruise Critical Fuel Reserves Ground to Air Miles Conversion AIR DISTANCE (NM) GROUND AIR DISTANCE (NM) HEADWIND COMPONENT (KTS) DISTANCE TAILWIND COMPONENT (KTS) 100 80 60 40 20 (NM) 20 40 60 80 100 294 268 247 229 214 200 188 177 168 159 152 603 548 501 462 429 400 375 352 333 315 299 913 827 756 695 644 600 561 528 498 471 447 1224 1106 1010 929 860 800 748 703 662 626 594 1534 1386 1264 1162 1075 1000 935 878 827 782 742 1844 1665 1518 1395 1290 1200 1122 1053 992 938 889 2154 1945 1772 1628 1505 1400 1308 1228 1157 1094 1037 2465 2224 2027 1861 1721 1600 1495 1403 1322 1249 1184 2775 2504 2281 2094 1936 1800 1682 1578 1487 1405 1332 Critical Fuel (1000 KG) AIR DIST WEIGHT AT CRITICAL POINT (1000 KG) (NM) 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 200 1.7 1.7 1.8 1.9 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.1 300 2.4 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0 400 3.1 3.1 3.2 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.9 500 3.8 3.8 4.0 4.1 4.3 4.4 4.6 4.7 600 4.5 4.5 4.7 4.9 5.0 5.2 5.4 5.6 700 5.2 5.2 5.4 5.6 5.8 6.0 6.2 6.4 800 5.9 5.9 6.1 6.4 6.6 6.8 7.0 7.3 900 6.6 6.6 6.8 7.1 7.3 7.6 7.8 8.1 1000 7.3 7.3 7.5 7.8 8.1 8.4 8.6 8.9 1100 8.0 8.0 8.2 8.5 8.8 9.1 9.4 9.7 1200 8.7 8.7 8.9 9.3 9.6 9.9 10.3 10.6 1300 9.4 9.4 9.6 10.0 10.4 10.7 11.1 11.4 1400 10.1 10.1 10.3 10.7 11.1 11.5 11.8 12.2 1500 10.8 10.8 11.0 11.4 11.8 12.2 12.6 13.0 1600 11.5 11.5 11.7 12.1 12.6 13.0 13.4 13.8 1700 12.2 12.2 12.4 12.8 13.3 13.7 14.2 14.6 1800 12.9 12.9 13.1 13.5 14.0 14.5 15.0 15.4 Based on: Emergency descent to 10000 ft.
