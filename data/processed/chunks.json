    "contextualized_text": "This table is from the Performance Dispatch section, used to determine the maximum takeoff weight for a Boeing 737-600 with CFM56-7B22 engines under specific conditions (Dry Runway, Flaps 5, Sea Level). Key terms include \"Field Limit Weight,\" the maximum weight allowed by the runway length for a given Outside Air Temperature (OAT), and \"Climb Limit,\" a separate weight limitation ensuring the aircraft meets minimum climb performance requirements with one engine inoperative.

Key technical terms include \"Margin to Initial Buffet 'G',\" which represents the G-load (and corresponding bank angle) the aircraft can sustain before stall buffet, and the asterisk (*), which denotes when maximum altitude is limited by available engine thrust rather than by buffet margin.\n\n737-600/CFM56-7B22 FAA/JAROPS Category D Brakes\n\nPerformance Dispatch\n\nChapter PD\n\nSection 11\n\nLong Range Cruise Maximum Operating Altitude PD.11 Performance Dispatch-Enroute Max Cruise Thrust\n\nISA + 10\u00b0C and Below\n\nWEIGHT OPTIMUM TAT MARGIN TO INITIAL BUFFET 'G' (BANK ANGLE) (1000 KG) ALT (FT) (\u00b0C) 1.20 (33\u00b0) 1.25 (36\u00b0) 1.30 (39\u00b0) 1.40 (44\u00b0) 1.50 (48\u00b0) 70 34500 -15 37700* 37700* 37700* 36400 35100 65 36000 -18 39200* 39200* 39200* 38000 36600 60 37700 -18 40700* 40700* 40700* 39700 38300 55 39500 -18 41000 41000 41000 41000 40100 50 41000 -18 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000 45 41000 -18 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000 40 41000 -18 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000 35 41000 -18 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000\n\nISA + 15\u00b0C\n\nWEIGHT OPTIMUM TAT MARGIN TO INITIAL BUFFET 'G' (BANK ANGLE) (1000 KG) ALT (FT) (\u00b0C) 1.20 (33\u00b0) 1.25 (36\u00b0) 1.30 (39\u00b0) 1.40 (44\u00b0) 1.50 (48\u00b0) 70 34500 -9 37000* 37000* 37000* 36400 35100 65 36000 -13 38300* 38300* 38300* 38000 36600 60 37700 -13 39800* 39800* 39800* 39700 38300 55 39500 -13 41000 41000 41000 41000 40100 50 41000 -13 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000 45 41000 -13 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000 40 41000 -13 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000 35 41000 -13 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000\n\nISA + 20\u00b0C\n\nWEIGHT OPTIMUM TAT MARGIN TO INITIAL BUFFET 'G' (BANK ANGLE) (1000 KG) ALT (FT) (\u00b0C) 1.20 (33\u00b0) 1.25 (36\u00b0) 1.30 (39\u00b0) 1.40 (44\u00b0) 1.50 (48\u00b0) 70 34500 -4 35700* 35700* 35700* 35700* 35100 65 36000 -7 37200* 37200* 37200* 37200* 36600 60 37700 -7 38700* 38700* 38700* 38700* 38300 55 39500 -7 40200* 40200* 40200* 40200* 40100 50 41000 -7 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000 45 41000 -7 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000 40 41000 -7 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000 35 41000 -7 41000 41000 41000 41000 41000\n\n*Denotes altitude thrust limited in level flight, 100 fpm residual rate of climb.",
